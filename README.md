# EMR_NLP_MachineLearning
A project to process free-text clinical reports with NLP and machine learning
Clinical notes are usually in free-text form and difficult to be processed by computers. Here we performed a research project to explore how does NLP can be used to process free-text data. Further, we used multiple machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models to classify the clinical notes into sub-groups.
## Files included
There are four files included in the repository:
'NLP_Report_Process_clean.py' is used to process raw text data.
'NonDL_models_clean.py' is used to perform classification with non-RNN models.
'LSTM_keras_03012018_clean.py' is used to perform RNN models.
'visualizeModels_clean.py' is used to perform results visualization.
